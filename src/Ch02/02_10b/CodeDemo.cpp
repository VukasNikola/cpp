int main(){
    float target_x; //used to store the location calculated
    int32_t sprite_x;

    target_x = -123.45; //double because it doesn't have an f at the end. You can assign a double to a float... Here the double is being implicitly converted to float.
    sprite_x = target_x; // implicit or casting, value gets truncated so we expect -123
    player_x = sprite_x;

    std::cout << "Target X (float): " << target_x << std::endl;

    std::cout << std::endl << std::endl;
